# Intro

In this post we will try to explain the origins and needs of the **machine** and where **artificial intelligence** naturally fits in.

Since the biginning of our existence we have always been using our body to do our day to day tasks. Whether it is moving from one place to another we used our feet; to work in the plantions we used our hands; etc. But we have been attempting to automate all those tasks to save energy. Then we automated our feet by making the wheel and our 

Another thing we tried to automate was calculations when trading. This lead to the invention of the mechanical computer by Charles Babbage. This idea of a computer will later be improved thanks to Alan Turing who invented the first moden computer as we know it, from its architecture at least.

The speciality of this computer is that it can theoretically perform any computation. Since we see our brain as machine that does just calculations, the computer was a good ... to automate it. That's where the story started.

Even though the computer invented by Alan Turing was only able to perform basic arithmetic calculations(but good enough to decipher the German code in the second world war), people like Alan Turing himself seeing a future of intelligence that could emerge from this machine.

People were very excited, and started doing search in the field of AI. One of the greatest pioneers of AI is John Mccarthy who..
